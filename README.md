# Philip 'MrPhil' Ludington

**Game Director | Software Engineer | Open Source Contributor**

I build games, game engines, and developer tools using systems languages. My focus is on agentic development and creating tools for AI-assisted workflows, especially with Claude Code.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Klar, Kira, C, Zig, C3, C#
- **Focus:** Agentic development, Claude Code tooling, game engines
