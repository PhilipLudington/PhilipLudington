# Philip 'MrPhil' Ludington

**Game Director | Software Engineer | Open Source Contributor**

I build games, game engines, and developer tools using systems languages. My focus is on agentic development and creating tools for AI-assisted workflows, especially with Claude Code.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Klar, C, Zig, C3, C#
- **Focus:** Agentic development, Claude Code tooling, game engines

## Featured Projects

### [Agentite](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/Agentite) / [AgentiteEditor](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/AgentiteEditor) / [AgentiteZ](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/AgentiteZ) / [AgentiteG](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/AgentiteG) / [AgentiteC3](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/AgentiteC3)
Game engines and tools designed for AI-assisted development. Agentite (C), AgentiteZ (Zig), AgentiteC3 (C3), AgentiteG (Godot), and a Unity-like editor for seamless human-AI collaboration in game creation.

### [zig-msdf](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/zig-msdf)
Multi-channel signed distance field library written in pure Zig. Useful for rendering crisp text and vector graphics in games.

### [zig-png](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/zig-png)
PNG decoding/encoding library implemented in pure Zig with no dependencies.

### [Carbide](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/Carbide) / [CarbideZig](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/CarbideZig) / [CarbideUnity](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/CarbideUnity) / [CarbideC3](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/CarbideC3)
Hardened development standards and patterns for C/C++, Zig, Unity/C#, and C3. Designed for safe, consistent code when working with AI-assisted development.

### [Klar](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/Klar) / [MCP-Klar](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/MCP-Klar) / [Klar-Toolkit](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/Klar-Toolkit)
A programming language designed for Claude Code and AI-assisted development, written in Zig. Includes an MCP server for AI integration and hardened development standards.

### [Chronicle](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/Chronicle)
A Zig CLI changelog generator that parses conventional commits and outputs structured entries, with a Claude Code skill wrapper for AI-polished release notes.

### [Koda](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/Koda) / [libkoda-terminal](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/libkoda-terminal)
Koda Terminal and its supporting Zig library for terminal features and functionality.

### [mcp-unity](https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity)
Model Context Protocol plugin connecting Unity Editor with AI assistants (Claude, GPT, Gemini, and more).

## Games in Development
