# Philip Ludington

**Game Director | Software Engineer | Open Source Contributor**

I build games and game engines using systems languages. My focus is on performance-critical code and exploring modern alternatives to C/C++.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** C, Zig, C3, C#
- **Focus:** Game development, engine architecture, agentic game development

## Featured Projects

### [Agentite](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/Agentite)
A C game engine designed for AI agents and agentic game development. Built from the ground up to enable human-AI collaboration in game creation.

### [AgentiteEditor](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/AgentiteEditor)
A Unity-like editor for the Agentite engine, designed for seamless collaboration with AI assistants.

### [zig-msdf](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/zig-msdf)
Multi-channel signed distance field library written in pure Zig. Useful for rendering crisp text and vector graphics in games.

### [zig-png](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/zig-png)
PNG decoding/encoding library implemented in pure Zig with no dependencies.

### [Carbide](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/Carbide) / [CarbideZig](https://github.com/PhilipLudington/CarbideZig)
Hardened development standards and patterns for C/C++ and Zig. Designed for safe, consistent code when working with AI-assisted development.

### [mcp-unity](https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity)
Model Context Protocol plugin connecting Unity Editor with AI assistants (Claude, GPT, Gemini, and more).

## Games in Development

### Crimson Crisis
Currently in development. [Wishlist on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/crimsoncrisis)

### Stellar Throne
A grand strategy game being built with the Agentite engine. Features a simulation engine with 52x performance improvements through recent optimizations.

## Currently Working On

- **Agentite** - Building a game engine from scratch in C, optimized for AI-assisted development
- Exploring **Zig** and **C3** as modern alternatives to C/C++ for game development
- **Carbide** frameworks - Hardened development standards for safe AI-assisted coding
